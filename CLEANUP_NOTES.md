# Armatillo App Cleanup Notes

## Completed Improvements

1. **Path Configuration Updated**
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to support `@/app/*` path aliases
   - Ensures consistent import paths across the application

2. **Themed Component System**
   - Created new `app/components/Themed.tsx` using the app's theme system
   - Updated imports in `app/components/index.ts` to export themed components
   - Eliminated dependency on old ThemedComponents

3. **Modal Screens Fixed**
   - Updated `app/modal.tsx` to use new themed components
   - Applied proper theme styling with type annotations

4. **Tabs Layout Improved**
   - Updated `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to use theme system
   - Removed dependency on old Colors.ts

5. **ErrorBoundary Converted to TypeScript**
   - Created `app/ErrorBoundary.tsx` with proper type annotations
   - Removed old JavaScript version

## Remaining Cleanup Tasks

1. **Remove Redundant Files and Folders**
   - `/components/` directory should be fully removed
   - `/constants/Colors.ts` should be removed as we now use the app/constants/theme.ts system
   - Update any remaining imports to use the new paths

2. **Fix Any Remaining Hard-coded Styles**
   - Ensure all components use the theme system rather than hard-coded colors/styles

3. **Update Import Paths Consistently**
   - All imports should consistently use either:
     - `@/app/...` for files inside the app directory
     - Relative imports (../path) for closely related files
     - Avoid mixing path styles

## Guidelines for Future Development

1. **Styling Best Practices**
   - Always use the theme system for consistency
   - Define styles with proper TypeScript annotations (ViewStyle, TextStyle)
   - Avoid hard-coded values

2. **Component Structure**
   - Keep all components within app/components
   - Export via index.ts for easy importing
   - Use TypeScript for all new components

3. **Path Imports**
   - Use alias imports for unrelated areas of the app
   - Use relative imports for closely related files
