# Armatillo App Cleanup Notes

## Completed Improvements

1. **Path Configuration Updated**
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to support `@/app/*` path aliases
   - Ensures consistent import paths across the application

2. **Themed Component System**
   - Created new `app/components/Themed.tsx` using the app's theme system
   - Updated imports in `app/components/index.ts` to export themed components
   - Eliminated dependency on old ThemedComponents

3. **Modal Screens Fixed**
   - Updated `app/modal.tsx` to use new themed components
   - Applied proper theme styling with type annotations

4. **Tabs Layout Improved**
   - Updated `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to use theme system
   - Removed dependency on old Colors.ts

5. **ErrorBoundary Converted to TypeScript**
   - Created `app/ErrorBoundary.tsx` with proper type annotations
   - Removed old JavaScript version

6. **Import Path Standardization**
   - Updated all component imports to use `@/app/*` path aliases
   - Standardized imports across all tabs, screens, and components
   - Fixed circular dependencies and import issues

7. **Component Refactoring**
   - Updated all base UI components to use proper theming
   - Improved `InstanceDetailsModal` and `EmojiSelectionGrid` components
   - Applied proper TypeScript typings to component props and styles

8. **Navigation Path Corrections**
   - Fixed paths in the home screen and tracking flows
   - Ensured consistent navigation between screens
   - Updated screen references to match the proper directory structure

9. **Style System Improvements**
   - Replaced hard-coded colors with theme values
   - Added proper TypeScript assertions to all styles
   - Fixed background colors and transparency issues in nested components

## Current Status

All major cleanup tasks have been completed. The codebase now has:

- Consistent import paths using the `@/app/*` pattern
- Fully typed components with proper style annotations
- Proper usage of the theme system throughout the UI
- Correct navigation between screens and tabs
- No remnants of old component or style systems

## Guidelines for Future Development

1. **Styling Best Practices**
   - Always use the theme system for consistency
   - Define styles with proper TypeScript annotations (ViewStyle, TextStyle)
   - Avoid hard-coded values
   - Set `backgroundColor: 'transparent'` for nested View components when appropriate

2. **Component Structure**
   - Keep all components within app/components
   - Export via index.ts for easy importing
   - Use TypeScript for all new components
   - Favor composition with smaller, reusable components

3. **Import Patterns**
   - Use `@/app/...` alias imports consistently throughout the codebase
   - Import components from the barrel file where possible (`@/app/components`)
   - Always use the themed `View` and `Text` components instead of React Native defaults

4. **Navigation**
   - Follow the established pattern for screen paths
   - Use full paths for navigation (`/screens/tracking/...`)
   - Maintain the tab structure for main navigation

5. **TypeScript Usage**
   - Always provide proper typings for component props
   - Use interfaces for complex data structures
   - Add explicit type assertions for styles
   - Avoid using `any` type where possible

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Theme Extension**
   - Implement dark mode support in the theme system
   - Create a theme context for runtime theme switching

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement memoization for expensive calculations or renders
   - Consider lazy loading for modals and infrequently used screens

3. **Accessibility**
   - Add proper accessibility labels and hints
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast for text elements
   - Support dynamic text sizing

4. **Testing**
   - Add component unit tests
   - Implement integration tests for key user flows
   - Set up E2E testing for critical functionality
